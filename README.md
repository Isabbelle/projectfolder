Frameworks: React, Axios


to run: npm start

Because I never worked with json files it was difficult at first to find a solution on how to display them in the React.
I came with the solution that I would create a seperate database and I included a couple of companies and categories. 
I used Axios.js so that I can fetch data like I normally would from an API. I managed to display a small list of companies.

What I would have done if I had more time:
I would create components to display like this: 
     a) cards  with the company titles + logo; b) in the card I would have created a button ("Show insurances provided") that would link to the categories of insurance that each company provides.
     I would have documented myself more on how to access directly json data and display it in react (this is what actualy took most of the time).
As a conclusion if I had more time I would also style the app but most important I would have gave the app the functionality I wanted.
